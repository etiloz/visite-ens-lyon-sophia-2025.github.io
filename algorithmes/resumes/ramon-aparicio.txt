Renewable microgrids can help data centers cope with the increasing demand for cloud-based services, but they pay the price of the double uncertainty of workload and renewable resource availability.  The mismatch between demand and renewable supply prevents microgrid-based data centers from achieving full autonomy, requiring connection to the main grid. However, while imports from the main grid could increase environmental impact, the massive export of excess renewables, when injected into the grid, can cause serious instability in the system. This presentation proposes to address both issues using AI compressible tasks, whose potentially concave utility functions allow for the adaptation to the available resources, reducing or increasing the task size with negligible impact on the quality provided to the user. By absorbing surplus renewable energy, they help maintain frequency stability in the main grid, thereby supporting grid-forming operations.
