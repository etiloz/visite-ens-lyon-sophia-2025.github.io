### Description

The recent development of concurrent and distributed applications has sparked a new interest in programming paradigms that incorporate the use of threads and message passing into their logic. The use of choreographies, which are behavioural types, can avoid some of the typical pitfalls of concurrent systems (such as liveness, lock freedom and deadlock freedom). ChorEr [2] is a preliminary static analysis tool for a fragment of Erlang programs that generates choreography automata [1]. We plan to build on the existing tool to implement new functionalities and cover more primitives, thus extending the expressiveness of the language under consideration.
