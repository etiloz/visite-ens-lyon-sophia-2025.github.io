### Description

NeuroEvolution (NE) refers to a family of methods for optimizing Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) using Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms. NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is considered one of the most influential algorithms in the field.
The goal of this project is to study NEAT and all of its possible variants for optimizing the artchitecture of deep architectures.
