### Description

Logical Frameworks (LF’s) and Assistants for Formal Logics
based on Constructive Type Theory have been developed since
the ‘80’s following the seminal work by Martin Löf, Huet,
Coquand, Harper, Honsell, Plotkin up to the formidable
achievements of Coq, Agda, Isabelle, Lean, and Matita, just to
mention a few. Type Theory has become a “Lingua Franca” to
express formal reasoning in the most diverse settings. These
assistants have been empowered with many features both
deductively and computationally e.g. rewriting, polymorphism,
unification, thus producing an ecosystem of theories and tools,
with related interactive theorem provers overcoming
idiosyncrasies and incompatibilities. Efforts towards the
standardisation of a common baseline logic based on type
theory, as a sort of κοινὴ διάλεκτος, has been carried out during
the Action. Grammatical Frameworks (GF’s) have been used in
numerous projects for translating between informal and formal
languages, in particular in the mathematics and legal domains.
GF’s work like a compiler that converts between abstract syntax
trees and concrete languages, also supporting translation
between languages via abstract syntax. Prior experiences make
us confident that we can support several natural languages even
in this project.

Le stage demande de connaissance en logique, Rocq proof assistant, programmation fonctionnelle, grammaires et parsers et il pourra continuer en stage long et en thèse.

Possible un co-advising avec le Prof Furio Honsell, Université de Udine.
