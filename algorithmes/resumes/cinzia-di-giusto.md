## Session type disciplines
### Cinzia Di Giusto (Scale)

Session type disciplines provide a formal framework for specifying and verifying structured patterns of communication between concurrent or distributed processes. Originating from type theory, session types describe not only the type of data exchanged but also the protocol governing the order and direction of messages in a communication session. By enforcing these communication contracts at the type level, session type systems guarantee  properties such as deadlock-freedom, communication safety, and protocol compliance. This approach has proven effective in bridging the gap between theory and practice in the design of reliable concurrent and distributed systems, influencing modern programming languages and formal verification tools. Current research support asynchronous communication, multiparty interactions, and protocol synthesis.
