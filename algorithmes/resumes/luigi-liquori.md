## Redactable smart contracts in electronic ledgers (blockchain)
### Luigi Liquori (Kairos)

We introduce the research and standardisation (ISO & ETSI) advances on studying, understanding and assessing Smart Contract Languages, in particular to their, so called, IMMUTABILITY, or NON RETRACTABILITY.  Smart contracts are the artifact of the blockchain that provide immutable and verifiable specifications of physical transactions. As example, the language Solidity aims at reducing the transaction costs occasioned by the execution of contracts on the distributed ledgers such as the Ethereum. However, contracts need to adhere safety and security requirements that require formal verification and certification. This research and standardisation area aims to study different formal methods in order to guarantee safety properties of compilation AND execution on a distributed ledger (the blockchain). Establish a clear static (Types) and dynamic semantic (Lambda-calculus, Term Rewriting System) of those programming languages is also worth of study.
