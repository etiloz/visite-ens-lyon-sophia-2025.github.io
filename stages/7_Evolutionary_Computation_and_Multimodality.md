### Description

Evolutionary multimodal optimisation (MMO) has always received considerable attention in the community. Most of the CEC and GECCO competitions on MMO are based on a suite of benchmark functions proposed in 2013. In this suite, all functions have a finite number of local or global optima. On the other hand, much work has been done to exploit plateaus during artificial evolution to prevent algorithms from getting stuck on local optima. To our knowledge, no benchmark function has yet been proposed that considers an infinite number of optima, which is much more challenging for population-based metaheuristics.
