### Description

The present stage explore a more wide standardisation project, conducted at ETSI, in Sophia Antipolis, defining standardization issues for Smart Contracts, as defined in Data Act [i.1], and based on Electronic Ledgers as defined by eIDAS2 [i.2]. It builds on existing and planned standardization and publicly available specifications. It presents a novel and as yet unpublished Chain of Trust, by addressing the role of all involved entities in building, deploying, and executing a Smart Contract computer program on an Electronic Ledger. All the relevant actors, artifacts, hardware, networks and tools, are identified by emphasizing the critical points where governance, safety, security, and identity issues are required.  The security of Smart Contracts will be significantly compromised by an incomplete validation chain, which exposes users to various risks, including fraud and attacks.
